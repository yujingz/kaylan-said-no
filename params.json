{"name":"Kaylan Said No","tagline":"","body":"Store | Opinion\r\n------------ | -------------\r\nNUIce | Yes\r\nHMart | No\r\n\r\n## About me\r\nKaylan is a senior bubble tea researcher. She has been drinking bubble tea for over 20 years. Coming from a traditional Texas family, there are three 3 things she can't live without. Gun, baseball, and of course, bubble tea.  \r\n\r\nWith so many years of bubble tea knowledge, Kaylan is capable of telling the ignorant public which bubble tea shop you should go with a simple YES or NO. Dead simple.\r\n\r\n_BTW, if you are a bubble tea shop owner, for a cost of $50 a month, you could move yourself from the NO to YES._\r\n\r\nÂ© 2015-2016 Knomatic. All Rights Reserved.
